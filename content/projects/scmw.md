## Description
The supply chain management system is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the operations of distributors, retailers and manufacturers within a complex supply chain network. Leveraging a robust multitenant architecture, the system provides a secure and scalable platform for managing the end-to-end processes involved in the distribution and retail of products.

The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of order management, facilitate seamless communication among stakeholders, and provide real-time insights into the status of orders and inventory. By integrating the capabilities of Django and Reactjs, I aim to deliver a user-friendly interface that caters to the distinct requirements of each tenant, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers and sales representatives.
