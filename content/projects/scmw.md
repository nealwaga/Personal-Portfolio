## Description
The supply chain management system is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the operations of distributors, retailers, and manufacturers within a complex supply chain network. Leveraging a robust multitenant architecture, the system provides a secure and scalable platform for managing the end-to-end processes involved in the distribution and retail of products.

The primary objective of this system is to enhance the efficiency of order management, facilitate seamless communication among stakeholders, and provide real-time insights into the status of orders and inventory. By integrating the capabilities of Django and ReactJS, we aim to deliver a user-friendly interface that caters to the distinct requirements of each tenant, including manufacturers, distributors, retailers, and sales representatives.

This design document outlines the architectural framework, data models, functionalities, and key components that constitute the supply chain management system. It provides a comprehensive overview of the system's structure, highlighting the key features and implementation strategies to ensure a seamless and efficient management process for all stakeholders.
